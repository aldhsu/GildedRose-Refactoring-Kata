## Preamble
- Thought it might be a good idea to write something about refactoring
- Was looking for a refactoring game
- Happened on this which I have seen Sandi Metz run through what feels like a long time ago
- Going to try my hand at it and document my progress

## Thoughts
- Cover features in tests
- Found a bug in max quality for regular items

## Refactoring strategies
- Things are going to get worse before they get better
- simplify the code so what is actually important can show

## Thoughts
- Switches are based on the item name seems like a class is needed here
